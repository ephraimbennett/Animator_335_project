risks:

MachineFactory, Machine, MachineSystemFactory, MachineSystemActual -> the way we toggle through machines works for now
but is definitely inadequate as we connect to CanadianExperience and are toggling through user generated
options. *fixed;

playing back to back notes is weird right now. *fixed;

fix some drawing stuff and standardize constant usage in machine factory *fixed;

connect the cymbal tube in machine 2 correctly *fixed;

there is a weird bug where at the end of the card everything just starts playing. Probably has something to do with
the average brightness so need to tell card reader when the card is finished being read. *fixed;

cymbal shaking glitches sometimes
